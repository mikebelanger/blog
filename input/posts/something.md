While languages like [Rust](www.rust-lang.org) and [Go](https://go.dev/) have proven themselves to be newer, safer alternatives to more "traditional" system languages like C++, there's other languages which haven't received as much attention.  [Nim](http://nim-lang.org), [Zig](http://ziglang.org) have shown some impressive benchmarks.  One language that hasn't received nearly as much attention is [Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org).

```crystal
class SomeClass
  def someMethod
    puts "This prints to stdout"
  end
end
```

```js
function somefunc() {
  let x = 1;
  return x;
}

class SomeClass {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
  someMethod() {

  }
}
```
